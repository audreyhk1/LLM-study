                For each version: 
                1. Fully preserve the original meaning of the question. This includes retaining **all numbers, critical words, and key phrases** from the original question without omission or simplification. 
                2. Adapt minor, stylistic elements such as sentence structure or connective words to align with the literacy level's complexity.
                3. Ensure each rephrased version remains clear and faithful to the original context while testing literacy skills suitable for its target level. 
                4. Avoid introducing new information, changing the meaning, or omitting any part of the question that conveys vital details or context.
