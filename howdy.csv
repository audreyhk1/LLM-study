His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), his pulse is 90/min, his respirations are 18/min, and his blood pressure is 175/110 mmHg. His pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 91%. There are diffuse and inspiratory crackles at the bases of all lungs. There are two or more pitting edemas on both ankles. Laboratory test results are in: Hemoglobin 8.9 g/dL Hematocrit 27% Serum urea nitrogen 55 mg/dL Creatinine 2.9 mg/dL Urine RBCs 20-40/hpf Urinalysis also shows some dysplastic RBCs and, rarely, RBC casts. Examination of a renal biopsy specimen shows crescentic glomerulonephritis and linear IgG deposits along the glomerular capillaries. This patient most likely has antibodies to which of the following antigens?","A 32-year-old man presented with a cough that produced a small amount of blood 1 day later and shortness of breath and swelling in his ankles 2 days later. He also had episodes of progressive fatigue and dark urine over the past 2 weeks. He had no major medical history and was not taking any medications. His temperature was 37°C, his pulse was 90 beats per minute, his respirations were 18 breaths per minute, and his blood pressure was 175/110 mm Hg. His oxygen saturation was 91% on room pulse oximetry. Diffuse inspiratory crackles were heard at all lung bases. He had 2+ edema in both ankles. Laboratory findings showed hemoglobin 8.9 g/dL, hematocrit 27%, serum urea nitrogen 55 mg/dL, creatinine 2.9 mg/dL, and urinary red blood cells 20-40/hpf. Urinalysis revealed several dysmorphic red blood cells and rare red blood cell casts. Examination of a renal biopsy specimen reveals crescentic glomerulonephritis and linear deposits of IgG along the glomerular capillaries. This patient is likely to have retargeted antibodies to which of the following antigens?","A 32-year-old man comes to the office with a 1-day history of coughing up a small amount of blood and a 2-day history of shortness of breath and ankle swelling.

His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse 90/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 175/110 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry with room air shows an oxygen saturation of 91%. Diffuse respiratory crackles are heard in all lung bases. Both ankles have 2+ punctate edema. The results of laboratory tests are shown: Hemoglobin 8.9 g/dl Hematocrit 27 % Serum urea nitrogen 55 mg/dl Creatinine 2.9 mg/dl Urine RBC 20-40/hpf Urinalysis also shows some dysmorphic RBC and rare RBC wear. Examination of the renal biopsy specimen shows crescentic glomerulonephritis and linear deposition of IgG along the glomerular capillaries. This patient most likely has antibodies against which of the following antigens again?","A 32-year-old man presents to the office with a 1-day cough with small amounts of blood and 2 days of shortness of breath and ankle swelling.
